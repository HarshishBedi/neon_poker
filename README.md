# Neon Poker

Neon Poker is an electrifying twist on classic Texas Hold’em, blending traditional poker strategy with futuristic AI-powered abilities. The game is played with 2-6 players, each dealt two private hole cards and a unique AI card, adding a dynamic layer of strategy. Over four betting rounds—Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River—players bet, call, raise, or fold while leveraging their AI abilities to gain an advantage. The five community cards are gradually revealed, and the player with the best five-card poker hand at the end wins the round.
